- Codeigniter version is upgraded to 3.1.10
- created a modular system to add or remove different features
- created a Controller core to manage different type of controllers such as: 
    - <strong>backend</strong>: for admin side pages
    - <strong>frontend</strong>: for frontend side pages
    - <strong>membership</strong>: for the pages thad are using only for members
- created a Model core to use database tables as objects instead of writing a method for each query.
- created a Load core to use to manage modular system and load the CSS and JS file in different pages only when they are necessary
- created a library to create and manage forms, and keep them in one style
- created a library to create and manage data table lists and keep theme in one style
